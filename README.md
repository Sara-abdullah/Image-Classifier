# Image-Classifier-TensorFlow Project
Project code for Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow Nanodegree program. In this project, you will first develop code for an image classifier built with TensorFlow, then you will convert it into a command-line application.

# Data
- The data for this project is quite large - in fact, it is so large you cannot upload it onto Github. 
- You will be training using 102 different types of flowers, where there ~20 images per flower to train on. 
 - You will use your trained classifier to see if you can predict the type for new images of the flowers.

# Code File
Open file jupyter notebook Project_Image_Classifier_Project.ipynb
